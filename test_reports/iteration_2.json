All 4 requested corrections are working correctly: 1) last_record_date shows date of last record (null if no records), 2) New Opportunity creates linked records with previous_record_id, 3) Search works by name and phone, 4) Multiple co-signers allowed per buyer. Admin login with xadmin/Cali2020 works correctly.",
